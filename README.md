# Password Strength Checker

This Python script evaluates the strength of a given password based on several criteria, providing feedback on how secure the password is. The password strength is classified as **strong**, **moderate**, or **weak**, and suggestions are given to improve it.

## Features

- **Length Check:** Password must be at least 8 characters long.
- **Uppercase Check:** Password must include at least one uppercase letter.
- **Lowercase Check:** Password must include at least one lowercase letter.
- **Digit Check:** Password must include at least one numeric digit.
- **Special Character Check:** Password must include at least one special character (e.g., `@`, `#`, `!`, etc.).
- Provides feedback to the user on how to improve their password.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Run the script using Python:
```bash
   python password_checker.py
```
3-You will be prompted to enter a password. The script will then evaluate the password and provide feedback.

## How it works

The script uses Python's re module (regular expressions) to check for uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters in the password. The strength is evaluated based on the criteria met, and feedback is provided accordingly.
